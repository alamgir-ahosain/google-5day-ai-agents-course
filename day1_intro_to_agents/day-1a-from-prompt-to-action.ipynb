The grand palace was once the seat of the local zamindars (landlords) and is a magnificent example of historical architecture. With its intricate carvings, sprawling courtyards, and imposing structures, it offers a glimpse into the opulent lifestyle of Bengal's aristocratic past. While some parts are in disrepair, its historical significance and architectural grandeur continue to draw visitors. The zamindari family was granted titles of Raja and Maharaja by the British Raj, adding to the prestige of their residence.\n\n*   **Muktagachha Monda:** This is a very famous traditional sweetmeat that originated in Muktagachha. It's a type of \"Sandesh\" made primarily from khoa (reduced milk) and sugar, often flavored with cardamom. The \"Monda\" is a culinary icon of the region, with a history dating back to 1824. Many visitors come to Muktagachha specifically to try this delightful sweet, which is considered a symbol of the town's enduring culture and heritage.\n\n*   **Historical Significance and Cultural Heritage:** Beyond the Zamindar Bari, Muktagachha itself is a historic town in the Mymensingh Division. It has a history of fostering cultural activities, with zamindars known for patronizing arts and music. The town's name itself has an interesting etymology, believed to mean \"the city of pearls,\" derived from \"mukta\" (pearl) and \"gacha\" (cluster or collection). Another origin story links the name to a local inhabitant, Muktaram Karmakar, who presented a lampstand (gacha) to the zamindars, leading to the renaming of the area.\n\n*   **Proximity to the Brahmaputra River:** The town's location near the Brahmaputra River also adds to its scenic beauty and historical context.\n\nIn summary, Muktagachha's fame stems from its blend of historical grandeur, exemplified by the Zamindar Bari, and its unique culinary contribution, the renowned \"Monda\" sweet.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":24},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You can see a summary of ADK and its available languages in the response.\n\n### 2.4 How does it work?\n\nThe agent performed a Google Search to get the latest information about ADK, and it knew to use this tool because:\n\n1.

You've just seen the core concept of agent development in action.\n\nThe big takeaway is that your agent didn't just *respond*—it **reasoned** that it needed more information and then **acted** by using a tool. This ability to take action is the foundation of all agent-based AI.\n\n**ℹ️ Note: No submission required!**\n\nThis notebook is for your hands-on practice and learning only.
