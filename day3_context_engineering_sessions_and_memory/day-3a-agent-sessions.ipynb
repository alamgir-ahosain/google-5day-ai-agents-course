Drug discovery is one of the most exciting and rapidly advancing areas for AI in healthcare. Here are some of the latest developments and trends:\n\n**1. Accelerated Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **AI for Genomics and Proteomics:** AI algorithms are getting better at analyzing massive datasets from genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics to identify novel disease targets (genes, proteins, pathways) that were previously unknown or overlooked.\n    *   **Example:** AI can sift through millions of genetic variations to pinpoint those most likely to be involved in a specific disease, suggesting them as potential drug targets.\n*   **Network Biology and Causal Inference:** AI is being used to build complex models of biological networks and understand the causal relationships between different biological components. This helps researchers identify the most critical nodes in a disease pathway to target.\n\n**2. De Novo Drug Design (Designing New Molecules from Scratch):**\n\n*   **Generative AI Models:** This is a huge area. Models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and increasingly, **Large Language Models (LLMs)** adapted for molecular structures, are being used to design novel molecules with desired properties from scratch.\n    *   **Example:** Instead of screening existing libraries, AI can *create* entirely new chemical compounds that are predicted to bind effectively to a specific target, have good pharmacokinetic properties, and be less toxic.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning for Optimization:** AI is also used to iteratively refine these generated molecules, optimizing them for potency, selectivity, and drug-likeness through reinforcement learning.\n\n**3. Enhanced Hit-to-Lead and Lead Optimization:**\n\n*   **Predictive ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity):** AI models are becoming much more accurate at predicting how a drug candidate will behave in the body and its potential toxicities. This helps researchers prioritize promising compounds early on, saving time and resources.\n    *   **Example:** AI can predict a molecule's half-life in the bloodstream or its likelihood of causing liver damage before expensive lab tests are conducted.\n*   **Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) Modeling:** AI excels at identifying patterns between a molecule's chemical structure and its biological activity, guiding medicinal chemists in making precise modifications to improve efficacy and reduce side effects.\n\n**4. Revolutionizing Clinical Trial Design and Execution:**\n\n*   **Patient Stratification:** AI can analyze patient data to identify subgroups who are most likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more targeted and efficient clinical trials.\n*   **Predicting Trial Outcomes:** AI models can analyze historical trial data to predict the probability of success for new trials, helping pharmaceutical companies allocate resources more effectively.\n*   **Identifying Ideal Trial Sites and Investigators:** AI can optimize the selection of locations and researchers for clinical trials based on patient populations and historical performance.\n\n**5. AI in Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **Finding New Uses for Old Drugs:** AI can analyze vast amounts of biological, chemical, and clinical data to identify existing drugs that might be effective for treating new diseases. This is often faster and cheaper than developing entirely new drugs.\n    *   **Example:** AI might identify an existing antibiotic that shows promise in treating a rare cancer.\n\n**6. Integration of Real-World Data (RWD) and Real-World Evidence (RWE):**\n\n*   **Beyond Clinical Trials:** AI is crucial for analyzing RWD (from EHRs, wearables, insurance claims) to generate RWE that can inform drug development, assess post-market safety, and demonstrate value to payers.\n\n**Key Companies and Players:**\n\nMany companies are at the forefront, including:\n\n*   **Traditional pharma giants (Pfizer, Merck, Novartis)** are investing heavily in their own AI capabilities and partnering with AI-first biotech companies.\n*   **AI-native biotech companies (Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Exscientia, Atomwise, Insilico Medicine, BenevolentAI)** are built around AI-driven drug discovery platforms.\n*   **Tech giants (Google DeepMind, NVIDIA)** are developing foundational AI tools and platforms that are being applied to drug discovery.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\nDespite the rapid progress, challenges persist, including:\n\n*   **Data quality and standardization:** High-quality, curated datasets are essential for AI model training.\n*   **Experimental validation:** AI predictions still need rigorous experimental validation in the lab and clinic.\n*   **Interpretability and explainability:** Understanding *why* an AI makes a certain prediction is crucial for trust and regulatory approval.\n*   **Regulatory pathways:** Evolving regulatory frameworks are needed to keep pace with AI-driven drug discovery.\n\nThe field is dynamic, with new breakthroughs and partnerships announced frequently. AI is no longer a futuristic concept in drug discovery; it's becoming an indispensable tool that is fundamentally changing how new medicines are brought to patients.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the second development I mentioned: **De Novo Drug Design (Designing New Molecules from Scratch)**. This is a truly groundbreaking area where AI is moving beyond simply analyzing existing data to actively creating new possibilities.\n\nLet's dive deeper into what that means and how it's evolving:\n\n**What is De Novo Drug Design?**\n\nTraditionally, drug discovery involved:\n\n1.  **Screening:** Testing thousands or millions of existing chemical compounds against a disease target (e.g., a protein or enzyme).\n2.  **Modification:** Taking a promising \"hit\" compound and chemically modifying it to improve its effectiveness, reduce side effects, and make it more drug-like.\n\nDe novo design flips this. Instead of starting with what exists, AI is trained to understand the rules of molecular chemistry and biology and then **generates entirely new molecular structures** that are optimized to interact with a specific target and possess desired drug-like properties.\n\n**How AI is Enabling De Novo Design:**\n\nThe key AI technologies driving this are **generative models**. Think of these models as AI systems that can learn the underlying patterns and distributions of data (in this case, molecular structures and their properties) and then sample from that learned distribution to create new, realistic examples.\n\nHere are the primary types of generative models used:\n\n1.  **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**\n    *   **How they work:** GANs consist of two neural networks: a **generator** and a **discriminator**. The generator tries to create new molecular structures, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real molecules (from a training dataset) and generated ones. They train in an adversarial manner, pushing each other to improve.\n    *   **Application:** The generator learns to create molecules that are chemically plausible and could potentially bind to a target. The discriminator helps ensure the generated molecules are \"realistic\" in terms of their chemical structure.\n\n2.  **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):**\n    *   **How they work:** VAEs learn a compressed representation (a \"latent space\") of molecular structures. By sampling points from this latent space and decoding them, VAEs can generate new molecular structures.\n    *   **Application:** VAEs are good at creating diverse sets of molecules and can allow for more controlled generation by manipulating parameters in the latent space.\n\n3.  **Large Language Models (LLMs) and Transformer Architectures:**\n    *   **How they work:** Traditionally used for text, LLMs (like those behind ChatGPT) can be adapted to \"understand\" molecular representations (e.g., SMILES strings, which are text-based representations of molecules). They can then generate new sequences that represent novel molecules.\n    *   **Application:** LLMs are becoming increasingly powerful because they can capture complex relationships and long-range dependencies in molecular sequences. They can be fine-tuned on vast chemical databases and specific biological targets. This is a very rapidly evolving area within de novo design.\n\n4.  **Reinforcement Learning (RL):**\n    *   **How it works:** RL involves an agent (the AI) learning to make a sequence of decisions to achieve a goal, by receiving rewards or penalties.\n    *   **Application:** RL is often combined with generative models. The AI might generate a molecule, then an RL agent evaluates it based on predefined \"reward\" functions (e.g., high binding affinity to the target, low predicted toxicity, good solubility). The AI then learns to generate molecules that maximize these rewards.\n\n**Key Advantages of De Novo Design:**\n\n*   **Access to Novel Chemical Space:** AI can explore vast chemical spaces that have never been synthesized or tested, potentially discovering entirely new classes of drugs.\n*   **Speed and Efficiency:** Generating and prioritizing candidate molecules computationally is much faster than traditional experimental screening.\n*   **Optimization for Multiple Properties:** AI can be designed to optimize for several properties simultaneously (e.g., potency, selectivity, reduced toxicity, good pharmacokinetics), rather than just focusing on binding.\n*   **Personalized Drug Design:** In the future, de novo design could be used to create bespoke drugs tailored to an individual patient's specific genetic makeup or disease profile.\n\n**Examples of Progress:**\n\n*   **Discovery of novel antibiotics:** AI has been used to design molecules that kill bacteria by novel mechanisms, helping to combat antibiotic resistance.\n*   **Identification of potential cancer therapeutics:** AI has generated candidate molecules that inhibit specific cancer-driving proteins.\n*   **Creation of molecules with desired physical properties:** Beyond biological activity, AI can design molecules with specific solubility, stability, or manufacturing characteristics.\n\n**Challenges:**\n\n*   **Experimental Validation:** Generated molecules must still be synthesized and tested rigorously in the lab.\n*   **Predictive Accuracy:** While improving, predicting all relevant biological properties (especially long-term efficacy and rare side effects) with perfect accuracy remains a challenge.\n*   **Chemical Synthesis Feasibility:** Some AI-generated molecules might be extremely difficult or impossible to synthesize using current chemical methods.\n*   **Data Scarcity for Rare Targets/Diseases:** If there's very little known about a target or disease, training effective generative models can be harder.\n\nDe novo drug design represents a significant shift from \"finding\" drugs to \"designing\" them. It's a powerful testament to how AI can accelerate innovation in medicine by moving beyond analysis to true creation.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI-driven de novo drug design is dynamic and spans both established pharmaceutical giants and specialized AI-first biotech startups.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
